    "<p><strong>Cohort Analysis</strong> is an analytical techniques that focuses on analyzing the behavior of a group of users/customers over time, thereby uncovering insights about the experiences of those customers, and what companies can do to better those experiences. Instead of looking at all users in one broad view, cohort analysis breaks them down into groups. Cohort analysis measures the engagement of users over time. It tells us when the users fell in love with our products. This makes us easy to track down what certain actions we took that made customers keep coming back to use our service!</p>\n",

    "As a business owner, it is natural to ask yourself — are people like Bob coming back to my store as result of that trial set purchase? How fast is he going to come back and what value is he going to present to my company?\n",
    "\n",
    "So you ask your store attendant (their name is “Cookie” => browsers Cookie :)) to keep track of behavior of people like Bob, and see if they return and make a purchase, and how frequent those returns are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, four months later, you and “Cookie” sit down in your office desk and look through all Bob-like users that visited your store during the time of that specific promotion and bought a trial set. (by the way, this group of users that came in in that specific time frame is called a cohort).\n",
    "\n",
    "You realized that 70% of the people who bought the trial set never came back (bummer!), while 20% came back to your store at least once but didn’t buy anything, and the remaining 10% bought something in this four month period.</p>\n",
